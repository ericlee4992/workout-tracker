# Where the project is right now

Updated 2026-08-22 (second entry that day — barbell bar weight).
**Read this after `CLAUDE.md`** — SPEC and DECISIONS say what the product is and why; this says
what has actually happened and what to do next. Keep it current; it is the one file that goes
stale fastest.

## Status

Everything below is merged into local `main` and green: **362 unit + 14 UI tests**.
`github.com/ericlee4992/workout-tracker` (private).

| Shipped | What it is |
|---|---|
| Milestone 2 (`ce32158`) | Core loop on SwiftData — logging, prefill, PRs, snapshots, rest timer |
| Milestone 3 (`798372c`) | CSV/JSON export, D28–D32 — the only backup that exists |
| Label scanning (`64188e2`, `33be96d`) | Live camera reads a machine's name plate, ranks the 1877-model catalog, user confirms (D33–D35) |
| Exercise presets (`33be96d`) | Grips / single-double as variations that **split records** (D36–D38) |
| Collaboration setup (`b5dfac9`) | Signing moved to a gitignored `Config/Local.xcconfig`; CI runs unit tests on every PR |
| Barbell bar weight (2026-08-22) | Pick the bar, type plates per side, log the total (D39–D40). Half of milestone 6, brought forward |

**Two things are true and easy to miss:**

1. **Bar weight merged without its cross-review** (T6 waived on request — see Reviews in
   `DECISIONS.md`). The unreviewed surface is the D39 invariant: `weightValue` is the TOTAL,
   `barWeightValue` is provenance. Invert that anywhere and every barbell PR drops by the weight
   of a bar with no error raised.
2. **Almost none of it has met a real gym.** The scanner has never read a real name plate; no
   preset has been logged against in a session; bar mode has never been used to load a bar. Every
   threshold and layout is tuned against fixtures. Those answers should shape the next session
   more than the backlog does. (One item came off this list on 2026-08-22: an export of the real
   history now exists, in iCloud Drive.)

The app is being **dogfooded in real gym sessions** — that is the current activity. Feedback from
those sessions outranks new features.

## The live install (facts you cannot rediscover from the code)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Installed commit | The bar-weight merge (2026-08-22, installed 16:31 — the content is what is now on `main`, built from the working tree just before the merge commit existed). Installed before its Codex pass at the user's request, with a backup taken first (below) |
| Store migration | **Done on the real store, 2026-08-22.** `main` (`a3a6934`) was installed first so an export could be taken, then the branch build; it launched, so `SetRecord.barWeightValue` migrated the user's actual data. `a3a6934` can no longer open that store — the migrated schema is one-way without the export |
| Backup | CSV + JSON exported to iCloud Drive on 2026-08-22 before the schema change — the first copy of the training history off the device. Re-export after any session worth keeping |
| Previous installed commit | `33be96d` (2026-08-12) — export, live label scanning, movement labels, presets |
| iPhone UDID | `00008130-001E10C01E62001C` |
| Apple Team ID | `X68M8SR6NA` — now in `Config/Local.xcconfig` (gitignored), **not** in `project.pbxproj` |
| Signing | **Free** Apple account → builds expire **7 days**. Last signed **22 Aug 2026**, so expires **~29 Aug 2026**. Each reinstall resets the clock |
| Bundle ID | `com.ericlee4992.workouttracker` (from `WT_BUNDLE_ID_BASE` in `Config/Local.xcconfig`) |
| Test simulator | `WT-iPhone` (create per CLAUDE.md if missing) |

**Reinstalling** preserves the user's data — same bundle ID keeps the container. Say so before an
install; that phone holds the only copy of the training history until an export is saved off it.

The wizard (`./scripts/install-on-device.sh`) is interactive and meant for a human. With the
signing identity and Developer Mode already in place, the direct path is three commands:

```sh
xcrun devicectl list devices                      # confirm udid 00008130-…, transport, tunnel state
xcodebuild -project WorkoutTracker.xcodeproj -scheme WorkoutTracker -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS,id=00008130-001E10C01E62001C' -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/wt-device-build build
xcrun devicectl device install app --device 00008130-001E10C01E62001C \
  /tmp/wt-device-build/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/WorkoutTracker.app
```

Gotchas seen doing exactly this on 2026-08-11: the phone pairs over **localNetwork**, and its
tunnel reads `disconnected` until something asks for it — the first install attempt died with
`NWError 60 - Operation timed out` and the identical retry succeeded. Do not conclude the phone is
unreachable from one timeout. `devicectl device process launch` additionally needs the phone
**unlocked**, and fails with `FBSOpenApplicationErrorDomain error 7` when it is not; that says
nothing about whether the install worked.

## What to do next, in priority order

1. **Act on gym feedback.** Six questions are open and no test can answer them. The three newest,
   from the bar mode installed 2026-08-22:
   - Is **plates per side** what the user thinks in while loading, or total plates?
   - In bar mode PREVIOUS shows last session's **total** while the field takes **plates**. Does
     the `= 135 lb` caption reconcile that mid-set, or does it read as two different numbers?
   - Is a bar the user actually owns missing from `BarbellMath.presets`? Custom covers it, but a
     weekly bar belongs in the list.
   And the three still open from before:
   - Does the scanner read a **real** name plate? If it reads it but refuses to preselect, that is
     the D33 gate working, not a bug — a plate that does not name its manufacturer never
     preselects (95% of clean brand+model readings do, 0% of model-name-only ones), because a
     wrong model UUID splits history (D23). Thresholds live in `CatalogMatcher` (0.85 preselect /
     0.35 create-new / 0.08 margin), tuned against the catalog and rendered plates, not
     photographs. Retune only with real misses in hand.
   - Does the **export** look right over the real history in a spreadsheet?
   - Are the **preset chips** reachable one-handed mid-set? Their layout is guesswork.
2. **A cross-review of bar weight is still owed** (T6, waived at merge on 2026-08-22 — see the
   Reviews section of `DECISIONS.md`). It is merged and on the phone, so this is no longer a gate
   on anything; it is a debt. The D39 invariant is the thing to attack.
3. **Milestone 4 — progress charts** (Swift Charts; normalized axes, as-entered tooltips). The
   next unbuilt milestone, and what makes the logged history worth looking at.
4. Milestone 5: Strong CSV import. Milestone 6 is now **half done** — the bar half shipped
   2026-08-22; what remains is computing which plates to load for a target weight, and
   selectorized stack increments.

**Known latent bug, found while building bar mode, deliberately not fixed:** `Format.weight`
(`Domain/SharedEnums.swift`) renders to one decimal, and the set row's text becomes the stored
value on completion — so a prefilled 62.25 kg row commits as **62.3**. It only bites weights with
two decimals, which 2.5 lb/1.25 kg plate math does not produce, but it is a silent rewrite of the
user's own numbers. Bar mode's fields dodge it by seeding through `WeightMath.displayNumber`.

## Decisions the user has NOT made yet

- **Adding a human collaborator.** The repo was made ready for one on 2026-08-18 (per-developer
  signing, CI on PRs) and the user was weighing it. If someone joins, **D5 and T6 must be reopened
  deliberately**: D5 says the audience is the developer alone, and T6 justifies agent cross-review
  by there being no second pair of human eyes. Does a human PR approval replace the Codex pass or
  stack with it? Also unresolved: branch protection on `main` may need a paid plan for a private
  repo.
- **Apple Developer Program ($99/yr)** — needed for TestFlight, which is the only sane way to get
  the app to other testers and would also end the 7-day expiry. The user asked about it, weighed a
  free 2–3 family-member pilot first (possible, but every phone must be cabled to the Mac weekly).
  Prep work not started: app icon (**none exists** — App Store Connect rejects uploads without
  one), export-compliance key, upload script.
- **Catalog gaps worth closing** if the user hits them: Atlantis (dealer-sourced only), Titan and
  Sorinex (barely researched), Life Fitness Signature Series (discontinued but still on gym floors
  — the most commercially significant gap). See `docs/catalog-sources/README.md`.

## Environment gotchas that cost real time

- **Certificate chain.** Apple issues development certs from the WWDR **G3** intermediate. A Mac
  carrying only the original WWDR intermediate (expired 2023-02-07) reports "0 valid identities"
  and `codesign` fails with `errSecInternalComponent` — which reads as *no certificate* when the
  certificate is fine. Fix: install `AppleWWDRCAG3.cer`. Already done here; the install wizard now
  detects and repairs it.
- **Developer Mode** must be ON *and* confirmed after the phone restarts. `devicectl`'s
  `developerModeStatus` can report a stale `disabled` — attempt the build; it is authoritative.
- **Computer-use cannot drive this app.** Synthetic clicks reach the Simulator's UIKit tab bar but
  **not SwiftUI list buttons**. Use the XCUITest target (`WorkoutTrackerUITests/`) instead — that is
  why it exists.
- **A store fixture from the installed commit lives in `WorkoutTrackerTests/Fixtures/`.** Any
  schema change must open it (`LegacyStoreMigrationTests`) before going near the phone — that
  store is the shape of the user's real data, and "SwiftData infers this migration" is a claim,
  not evidence. Regenerate the fixture from the *installed* commit whenever the shape changes.
- **UI tests take ~7 minutes** and occasionally flake under load. A single red run is not
  automatically a real failure; re-run the failing test alone before believing it.
- **The Simulator has no camera.** Anything camera-driven needs a fixture path to be testable at
  all — hence `-uiTestScanFixture`, which renders a name plate in place of the picker. And a
  missing `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSCameraUsageDescription` is a *crash* on presentation, not a prompt;
  the project generates its Info.plist, so usage strings live in build settings.
- **A `.sheet` attached to a `Section` inside a `List` never presents.** No error, no warning —
  the state flips and nothing happens. Hang presentation off a row *inside* the section. Cost an
  export that silently did nothing (milestone 3, ticket 02); caught only by the XCUITest.

## Working agreements learned the hard way

- **Verify independently.** Twice, an agent reported the suite green and an independent re-run
  failed — once a genuine race (`CONTINUATION MISUSE` from an unfiltered `didSave` observer,
  fixed in `ce32158`). Run the suite yourself before believing a summary.
- **Cross-review is not optional** (T6). Codex reviews of Claude's work have caught, among others:
  template data loss on an empty templated workout, D23 violations where history read live rows,
  and ten duplicate catalog identities that would have split the user's own history. Reviews live
  in `.scratch/*/codex-review*.md`. Milestone 3's pass caught an export that dropped a draft
  entry's equipment and a CRLF-quoting bug that would have corrupted the CSV. The scanner needed
  **two** rounds, and the second round's worst finding was a defect introduced by the first
  round's fix — budget for a re-review after fixing criticals, not just after writing code.
- **State the consequence where the decision is made.** Every review that went well did so because
  a doc comment said what breaks if the rule is broken (usually: "this splits the user's history").
  Comments that only restate the code have caught nothing.
- **Locked decisions get reopened deliberately** — D26 (drop sets) reopened D12 rather than drifting.
- The user prefers **seeing the UI** (screenshots from the simulator) over descriptions of it.
